# Educational AI Project: Student Final Math Grade Prediction

## Mission

My mission is to use artificial intelligence to enhance and streamline educational processes in Africa, with the goal of developing a world-class education system and improving learning outcomes for all students. While this project is only a starting point, it serves as an initial step toward understanding how AI can be applied to improve educational outcomes.

## Data Description

The objective of this project is to predict student final math grades (G3) using various academic, demographic, and social factors. This is based on the **student-mat.csv** dataset, which contains several columns capturing different attributes of students such as family background, school performance, and social behaviors. The ultimate goal is to identify students at risk of underperforming, providing educators and parents with the ability to offer timely support and interventions. By predicting student outcomes in mathematics, this project aims to improve educational practices and the way students are supported throughout their learning journey.
